% Algorithm variables
w = 3;
threshold = 0.1;
suppression = True;

% Load and convert image to black and white





% A. Harris Corner Detector
function [corner_coords, descriptors] = harris(I, w, threshold, suppression)
    % 1. Filter img with Gaussian window, W
    
    % 2. Compute magnitude of the gradient everywhere.
    
    % 3. Compute M matrix for each image window, using
    % the same W Gaussian window function.
    
    % 4. Computer the cornerness (R) scores for each image window.
    
    % 5. Find points whose surrounding window gave large corner 
    % response (R > threshold). 
    
    % 6. Take the points of local maxima (non-maximum suppression)
