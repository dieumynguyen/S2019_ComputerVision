function meanColorImg = MakeMeanColorImage(segments)
% Visualize a segmentation of an image by replacing each segment of the
% original image with its mean color.
%
% INPUTS
% segments - A struct array containing information about computed segments
%            as described in MakeSegments.m.
% meanColorImg - An array of the same size as the original image such that
%                meanColorImg(i, j, :) is the average color of the segment
%                to which pixel (i, j) of the original image has been
%                assigned.
