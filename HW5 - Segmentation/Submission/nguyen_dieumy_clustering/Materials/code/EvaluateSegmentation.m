function accuracy = EvaluateSegmentation(maskGt, x)
    % Compute the pixel-wise accuracy of a foreground-background segmentation
    % given a ground truth segmentation. You can provide the
    % foreground-background segmentation either as a mask (as output by
    % ChooseSegments) or as a struct of segmentation data (as described in
    % ComputeSegmentation). In the latter case, the best assignment of each
    % segment to either foreground or background is chosen automatically.
    %
    % USAGE 1: Automatically assign segments to either foreground or background
    % accuracy = EvaluateSegmentation(maskGt, segments)
    %
    %
    % INPUTS
    % maskGt - The ground truth foreground-background segmentation. A logical
    %          array of size h x w where maskGt(y, x) is true if and only if
    %          pixel (y, x) of the original image was part of the foreground.
    % segments - A struct array of segments as described in
    %            ComputeSegmentation.m.
    %
    % OUTPUT
    % mask - A logical array of the same size as maskGt where mask(y, x) is
    %        true if and only if the segment to which (y, x) was assigned was
    %        assigned to the foreground.
    %
    %
    %
    % USAGE 2: Use your own assignments of segments to foreground or
    %          background.
    % accuracy = EvaluateSegmentation(maskGt, mask)
    %
    % INPUTS
    % maskGt - The ground truth foreground-background segmentation. A logical
    %          array of size h x w where maskGt(y, x) is true if and only if
    %          pixel (y, x) of the original image was part of the foreground.
    % mask   - The computed foreground-background segmentation. A logical array
    %          of the same size and format as maskGt.
    %
    % OUTPUTS
    % accuracy - The fraction of pixels where maskGt and mask agree. A bigger
    %            number is better, where 1.0 indicates a perfect segmentation.

% Selects the subset of segments that give the highest accuracy on a given
% ground truth segmentation.

% mask - A logical array of the same size as maskGt where mask(y, x) is
%        true if and only if the segment to which (y, x) was assigned was
%        assigned to the foreground.
