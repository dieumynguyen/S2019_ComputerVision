% Quantitatively evaluate a segmentation method by comparing its computed
% segments against ground truth foreground-background segmentations.

% ../imageNames{i} is the ith image and ../gtNames{i} is the ground truth
% segmentation for this image.

% pixels that we want to cluster and then use this to determine the resize
% for each image.
