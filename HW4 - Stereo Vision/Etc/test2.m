% Basic block matching chooses the optimal disparity for each pixel based
% on its own cost function alone. Now we want to allow a pixel to have a
% disparity with possibly sub-optimal cost for it locally. This extra cost
% must be offset by increasing that pixel's agreement in disparity with its
% neighbors. In particular, we constrain each disparity estimate to lie
% with $\pm 3$ values of its neighbors' disparities, where its neighbors
% are the adjacent pixels along an image row. The problem of finding the
% optimal disparity estimates for a row of pixels now becomes one of
% finding the "optimal path" from one side of the image to the other. To
% find this optimal path, we use the underlying block matching metric as
% the cost function and constrain the disparities to only change by a
% certain amount between adjacent pixels. This is a problem that can be
% solved efficiently using the technique of dynamic programming [3,4].

% used for image acquisition can allow both positive and negative
% disparities to appear validly in the depth map. In this case, however,
% the stereo cameras were near perfectly parallel, so the true disparities
% have only one sign. Thus this correction is valid.
